#### About this project

This was a quick and dirty project that I do not intend to continue working on.  I wanted to complete it as fast as possible.

All glyphs were done in photoshop (and I took some artistic license, I know), and the site code was a rip of the Historic Tale Construction Kit - Bayeux, with modifications to get it working as fast as possible.
